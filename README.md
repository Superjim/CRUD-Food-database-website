# CRUD-Food-database-website
react, mysql, node.js, axios, express

My first react site, using Axios to send and request data to the backend. Still a big WIP.

Displays food, kcal, carbs fat protein data.

Data is inputted in a form by the user, when submitted it is added to a MySQL database.
The same data is read and displayed on the app.

I want to add a feature to generate a pie chart to show the ratio of carbs / fat / protein.
